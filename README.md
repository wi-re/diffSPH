# Differentiable SPH

This code will eventually end up being a differentiable SPH solver for weakly compressible two dimensional flow problems. The simulation was already used in the following publications:

- Symmetric Basis Convolutions for Learning Lagrangian Fluid Mechanics - R. Winchenbach and N. Thuerey - 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations Vienna, Austria (available here: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HKgRwNhI9R )
- A Hybrid Framework for Fluid Flow Simulations: Combining SPH with Machine Learning - R. Winchenbach and N. Thuerey - 2023 International SPHERIC Workshop Rhodes, Greece (pdf available under publications)
- Cross-Validation of SPH-based Machine Learning Models using the Taylor-Green Vortex Case - R. Winchenbach and N. Thuerey - Particle Methods and Applications Conference 2024 Santa Fe, USA (presentation and more information available here: https://pmac.fluids.dev )
